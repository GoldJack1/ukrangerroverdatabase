  "description": "HIGHLAND ROVER Unlimited travel with weekday time restrictions for Inverness and Aberdeen for any 4 days in 8 days. It includes the whole of the West Highland line from Glasgow Queen Street to Oban, Fort William and Mallaig as well as all routes north of Inverness, east to Aberdeen and south to Aviemore. The Highland Rover is separated into two parts. One part allows travel between Glasgow, Oban, Fort William and Mallaig over the West Highland line. The second part is between Inverness, Kyle of Lochalsh, Wick and Thurso on the Far North line and south of Inverness to Aberdeen and Aviemore. You cannot travel by rail between the two parts (as there is no northern connection) but you can by coach as the rover is also valid on Scottish CityLink and West Coast Motors between Oban, Fort William and Inverness but be aware that bus services are not integrated with Scotrail train times so if your train is delayed the buses will not wait and you could be stranded. The rover is also valid on Stagecoach Highland buses between Thurso and Scrabster. A 20% discount is available on Northlink ferry services between Scrabster-Stromness; Aberdeen-Lerwick and Aberdeen-Kirkwall-Lerwick. A 10% discount is available on both the Strathspey Steam Railway and the Keith & Dufftown Railway standard class fares. A 10% discount is available on both the Strathspey Steam Railway and the Keith & Dufftown Railway standard class fares. This ticket is no longer valid on Caledonian-MacBrayne ferry services.",
