LNER TVMs at Doncaster, Edinburgh, London King's Cross, Newcastle and York also sell them. A number of PTE areas sell local rangers from TVMs in their area e.g. South Yorkshire, Strathclyde and West Midlands * valid ticket to travel is required unless boarded at a station without ticket-issuing facilities Be aware that Transport for Wales have implemented \"Pay As You Go\" tap in/tap out with reduced fares and a daily price cap (a weekly cap is also available). This has resulted in the maximum daily fare in the Explore Cardiff & Valleys Day Ranger area being less than the price of the ranger. There are no time restrictions and validity extends to Newport, Abergavenny and Chepstow valid on TfW and Cross Country trains (not GWR). Find out more here ."
