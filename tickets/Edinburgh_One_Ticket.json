  "description": "EDINBURGH ONE TICKET Unlimited travel for either 7 days, a month or a year for rail travel from stations in central and south east Scotland into Edinburgh together with \n      bus services within the vicinity of the selected station and within the Edinburgh zone \n      ( see zonal map ). \n      There is also a 1 day version valid on buses only. A zonal system is used to calculate fares which extend as far north as Perth and Dundee, west to Falkirk, Shotts and Bathgate and south to Dunbar. \n      The area for buses is even larger but be careful not to confuse the fares and the areas for buses with rail and bus which are different. Prices vary dependent upon the zone but three examples are 7 days unlimited travel between Perth and Edinburgh zone stations is \u00a3114.00 and \n      from Dunbar is \u00a369.00; within the Edinburgh zone a 7 day ticket is \u00a338.00 which extends to Curriehill, Edinburgh Park, Dalmeny, Wallyford \n      and Newcraighall. All prices and zones can be found on the \"One Ticket\" website (link below). Except for the one day bus ticket a photocard is required for bus and rail tickets.",
